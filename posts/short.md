Workouts should be short and intense most of the time. Take a moment to venerate the "short." 

Short means you can workout any day you will it.

Short means more bang for your buck. Fitness - on sale - pennies on the dollar.

Short means getting it over with.

Short means you can sneak it in. While baby naps... while kids are at school... right before you get dinner started... after you park the car but before you leave the garage... using the time you didn't hit the snooze button over and over... 

Short means it's never too long you can't try.

Short means if it doesn't like it's right, you can stop, think, and start over.

Short means if you feel short-changed, you'll still have the time to add something right after.

Short means fast.

Faster means the same work in less time. The work done faster is intensity. Intensity produces results.
